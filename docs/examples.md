## Downloading examples

-   Go to the "Library Manager" and find "examples (download)" under an installed library. Note, not all libraries have examples!. Press the green download button
-   Check and modify (if needed) the target download path. Note, a file needs to be open so that the extension can get the working folder
-   The examples will be stored in a folder <library>\_examples, e.g. cadquery_examples
