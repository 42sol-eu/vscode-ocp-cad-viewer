# Debug code with visual debugging

- Ensure `OCP: on` is shown in the status bar:

    ![OCP:on](../screenshots/ocp-on.png)

    Clicking on it will toggle `OCP:on` (visual debugging) and `OCP:off` (no visual debugging)

- Set breakpoints and step over the code as usual

- At any point, variables can be deselected in the tree and visual debugging will remember the setting for the following steps (e.g. to unselect some temp variables "out of scope")
